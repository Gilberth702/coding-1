# arithmetic operators
#name = # Hamaaj # the equal sign is the operator
# use some combination of the equal 
# to give a variable a value 
# true or false 
#  comparisons operators allow us to evaluate data
# based on several factors 
# 10 less than 20
# greater than or equal 
# 100 = 100 
# 100 not the same as 10
# aritmatic allouw us to perform math with specifically with the integer and float
# data types 
# addition
# subtraction
# multiplication
# division 
# We use logical operators to evaluate if data is true or false 
# 10 x 3
# 100 / 4
# laptopdell = 1000
# password = '123' and 4 == mathAnswer
# securityQuestion = 'Franks'
# and - used to compare to condtitons that are both true 
# MathAnswer = 4
# If both conditions below are true we will have the value 
# of true
# or - used to compare conditions, But only one needs to
# to be true in order for the output to be true
# not - used to compare conditions, But will
# output the opposite result meaning if two things are ture
# we are going to get false
# whatever the real result is, will become the opposite
# Bookbag = 20.00
# Pens = 10.00
# Notebooks= 10.00
# coffeeMug= 20.00
# total = bookbag + pens + notebooks + coffeeMug
# Print (total)
# Getting the total checkout amount for items in a cart
# which python operator would you use if you wanted to determine if a user is old enough to purchase a video game
# Camparison operetor
# checking if someone is old enough to buy game 
# Age = 17 
# AgeToBuy = 17
# print(age > AgeToBuy)
# logical operator 
# we need to check if the student is in 12 AND has taken
# coding close.
# studentGrade = 12
# studentHasTakenCode = True
# print(studentGrade == 12 or StudentHasTakenCode == True)
